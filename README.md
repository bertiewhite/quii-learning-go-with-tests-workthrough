# quii-learning-go-with-tests-workthrough
My work whilst working through [quiis learning go with test](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests)

### Scrambled thoughts before properly starting
This is as much about practising TDD as much as learning go. A lot of the basics have already been covered but is useful
consolidation work as I learn it (esepcially as my work life has me flirting with java right now).

A lot of my code is going to end up looking like quii's.

Also gonna try actually using commits on a personal project. 
I don't often do that but I feel like it's not fully engrained into how I code, it's a concious effort to do, which it probably shouldn't be.

Also there's a 95% chance this gets abandoned as a git project and I just end up doing it locally.
